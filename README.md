## 🧠 BrainDumpster

A lovingly scrappy CLI app that asks: “What’s in your brain today?”
> If it’s rattling around in your skull, toss it in the Dumpster.

---

## 🤔 What’s This?

BrainDumpster is your daily mental unload station. Every morning (or whenever you crawl out of bed), it:
- Prompts you to dump your Top 3 goals into a JSON file.
- Reminds you what your yesterday self was trying to do.
- Helps you form a streak of intentional days without using another productivity cult app.

It’s not a dumpster fire. It’s a dumpster of focus.


---

## ⚙️ How does it work

```
python braindumpster.py
```

- If it’s your first time: 🎉 You’ll be asked to dump your 3 goals for today.
- If not: You’ll be shown yesterday’s mess and asked to craft today’s.

It’s like journaling, but for people who refuse to call it journaling.

---

## 💾 Features

- 🧠 Daily Top 3 goals, tracked forever (or until you delete the file)
- 📅 Shows you yesterday’s progress, no judgment
- 💾 Data saved locally in a brain_dump.json file
- 🧼 No cloud, no sync, no ads, no drama


---

## 🔜 Coming Soon (If Motivation Allows)
- Mark goals as “donezo”
- Mood slider (so your Dumpster can offer sympathy)
- ASCII graphs of streaks + consistency
- “Dumpster fire” mode that roasts your procrastination gently
